=============================================================================

To determine your starting Pokemon, you will be given a personality test.
This will involve a random question from 8 out of 14 Categories, with each
Category leaning towards a particular personality type.  Once you have been
asked the full eight questions, you will be given a final question that
simply asks for your gender.  Once this has been answered, the results are
all tallied and your final personality and resulting Pokemon is determined.

You will be given a Pokemon relating to the personality type you scored
highest in.  In the event of a tie between multiple personality types, one
will be chosen randomly out of those you scored highest in.  Finally, your
choice of gender dictates which of two Pokemon you will get for that
personality.


                              Male               Female
               Hardy:      #004 Charmander    #025 Pikachu
               Docile:     #001 Bulbasaur     #152 Chikorita
               Brave:      #066 Machop        #004 Charmander
               Jolly:      #007 Squirtle      #158 Totodile
               Impish:     #025 Pikachu       #104 Cubone
               Naive:      #158 Totodile      #133 Eevee
               Timid:      #155 Cyndaquil     #258 Mudkip
               Hasty:      #255 Torchic       #300 Skitty
               Sassy:      #252 Treecko       #255 Torchic
               Calm:       #258 Mudkip        #001 Bulbasaur
               Relaxed:    #054 Psyduck       #007 Squirtle
               Lonely:     #104 Cubone        #054 Psyduck
               Quirky:     #052 Meowth        #252 Treecko



Note that this gives a choice of 16 possible Pokemon, with 6 of them unique
to a particular gender.  Cyndaquil, Machop and Meowth are only available to
males, while Chikorita, Eevee and Skitty are only available to females.



Once your Pokemon has been chosen, you will be given a choice of partner.
The available partners are:

                     Bulbasaur   Charmander  Squirtle
                     Chikorita   Cyndaquil   Totodile
                     Treecko     Torchic     Mudkip
                                 Pikachu

You are unable to choose a partner that matches the Type of your own Pokemon.
Hence, Bulbasaur, Chikorita and Treecko cannot choose a Grass Type partner;
Charmander, Cyndaquil and Torchic cannot choose a Fire Type partner; and
Squirtle, Totodile, Mudkip and Psyduck cannot choose a Water Type partner.
Furthermore, if you get Pikachu as a result of the personality test, you
obviously cannot also choose Pikachu as your partner.

=============================================================================

If you're looking to try to get a particular Pokemon, you should keep the
following in mind:

   * Remember that six of the 16 possible Pokemon are available to one
     gender only - you will not be able to get them if you pick the
     wrong gender.

   * Keep in mind the personality of the Pokemon you're trying to get.
     You want to always answer questions that increase that personality
     trait.

   * When you're asked a question that doesn't have an answer for your
     chosen personality, pick answers that increase traits you haven't
     answered for yet and have low increases.  It's often better to
     answer a question with something that increases a bunch of traits
     by 1 instead of an answer that increases a single trait by 2 or
     even 3.


If you can increase your chosen trait high enough and keep the rest below
that, then it's not so difficult to get your chosen Pokemon.  Don't be
discouraged if it doesn't work the first time however - there is some luck
involved with which questions you will be asked.



=============================================================================
                         T H E   Q U E S T I O N S
=============================================================================

Remember that you will only be asked one question out of any Category chosen,
unless your answer to a question deliberately redirects you to another
question within that category.  You will also only be asked questions from
8 Categories maximum before you are given the final question to determine
your gender.
